# marklatch
Markov chain generator for Grinnell's Potlatch bid

## Usage
### Load the dictionary
This will drop you into a debugger (pry) where you can play around with the dictionary/chain, referenced by `d`:
```
> git clone https://github.com/alidaka/marklatch
> cd marklatch
> bundle install
> ./runme.rb
```
### Use the dictionary
```
[1] pry(main)> d.speak
=> "onmousedown"
[2] pry(main)> d.speak('stickies')
=> "stickies some love"
[3] pry(main)> 20.times { puts d.speak }
